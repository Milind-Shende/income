# üí∞ Annual Income Prediction

**The primary goal of the "Adult Census Income Prediction" project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into one of two income groups: those with an annual income of more than $50,000 and those with an annual income of less than or equal to $50,000. This problem is a classic example of a binary classification task.**

# üìô Dataset Source

**In our dataset we have 15 columns 32,561  Rows which reflect salary of various person. The target column is salary , which reflects whether person salary is Higher than 50K or less than 50K. Our aim is to predict the probability of salary of person. I have built my model using a public dataset available on kaggle.**

# üßò Motivation

**Societal Impact:** Predicting annual census income can help governments and policymakers allocate resources more efficiently. It can aid in identifying areas where social and economic support is needed, ensuring that public funds are directed toward those who require it the most.

**Poverty Reduction:** By accurately predicting income levels, your application can contribute to poverty reduction efforts. It can help target assistance programs to individuals and families with lower incomes, ensuring they receive the necessary support.

**Education:** Developing such an application can serve as an educational tool for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. You can use it as a personal or team project to gain experience in building predictive models, working with real-world data, and deploying applications.
